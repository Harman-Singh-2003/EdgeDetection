# Edge Detection Website
## https://harman-singh-2003.github.io/EdgeDetection/

The website will prompt you to upload an image saved from your device. Once you upload the image, it will instantly start running an edge detection program by placing the image in a Canvas tag in HTML. The program will then output the resulting image with a black background and white lines indicating the edges. The program converts the image to greyscale, then apply a gaussian blur with a 5x5 kernel, then does a pixel comparison between each pixel, and the pixels to its right and below it.
